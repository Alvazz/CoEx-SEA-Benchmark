Series Elastic Actuator Real time torque control

Torque Control Methods for Series Elastic Actuators


# Description
The series of codes are used to actuate and realize the real-time torque control of a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA). A SEA consists of an Electromagnetic Motor (EM), a reduction gear and an elastic element. Our actuator is comprised of a frameless and brushless motor (Kollmorgen TBM-7631) and a harmonic gearbox (Harmonic Drive CSG-25 with a conversion ratio of 1:100) in addition to a custom designed torsional spring. Both the motor side and the spring side are mounted with 39-Bit rotary encoders (Broadcom AS-38-H39E).

The set of codes provided here includes five different methods for controlling the torque output of the system; namely Proportional Integral Derivative Control (PID), cascaded PID control, Cascaded PID control with a disturbance observer (DoB), differential flatness (DF) with a DoB, feedforward (FF) PID control with a DoB and Sliding Mode Control (SMC).
